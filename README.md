## Overview

### Challenge

Build a very basic single-page application to create a Squad of Champions.

Using the provided Figma design and data files the application should:

1. Show a list of all Characters
2. Allow a user to filter the list of Characters
3. Allow a user to select up to 6 Characters
4. Show the selected Squad of Characters

#### What's provided

This repository contains the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) boilerplate code using the TypeScript template, a CSS reset, and the Mortal Kombot logo image. You are free to use any other boilerplate or React framework that uses TypeScript if you'd prefer.

We've also put together a `.json` file containing all Character data (sourced from [DashFight](https://dashfight.com/) and [EventHubs](https://www.eventhubs.com/)) from various fighting games (Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. and Dragon Ball Z). You can import this file directly into your code to complete the challenge. You'll find this in the `./src/data` directory.

##### Figma design files

- [Figma prototype (scrolling demo)](https://www.figma.com/proto/lARhl5uVfjSAf9wnOVJMNw/Squad-of-Champions?node-id=21%3A459&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1)

- [Figma design behaviour annotations](https://www.figma.com/file/41taXCaD9lqRhKKDO5tyNY/Squad-of-Champions---Comments?node-id=0%3A1)

#### Constraints

- 2–4 hours over ~5 days
- React + TypeScript

## Expectations

**We do not expect you to spend more than 2–4 hours on the challenge**, and we understand that it's unrealistic to implement a complete and polished solution in this time frame. We also have intentionally built-in some poor usability patterns that we'd love for you to improve upon. If you feel there was more you could do to improve it by the end of this time, please add some notes about what you'd change. We'll discuss these with you in person (or video call). We are looking for good architectural decisions, modularity, readability, and adherence to industry best practices.

## Submission

Once you've finished you can send us the URL to your repository via email. If your repository is private let us know and we'll send you the GitHub accounts that will need access to review the submission.

You are free to open source your work if you like.
